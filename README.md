<h1 align="center"> ðŸ”‘ Password Manager GUI via Tkinter </h1>

In this project, we create a password manager via **Tkinter**. The program expects three entries from the user, those are 
respectively:

* Website name
* Email or username
* Password (optional)

Password is an optional entry that can be generated by the program(By clicking on the `Generate Password` button). 
After filling entries, the user can click the `Save & Encrypt` button to save it in a txt file called **data.txt**.

To reach out the encrypted data, the user can copy and paste the info on the referring entry and click on the 
`Load & Decrypt` button.

Required modules for this project are:

* **tkinter**
* **random**

<h2> How does it work?</h2>
