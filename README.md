<h1 align="center"> ðŸ”‘ Password Manager GUI via Tkinter </h1>

In this project, we create a password manager via **Tkinter**. The program expects three entries from the user, those are 
respectively:

* Website name
* Email or username
* Password (optional)

Password is an optional entry that can be generated by the program(By clicking on the `Generate Password` button). 
After filling entries, the user can click the `Save & Encrypt` button to save it in a txt file called **data.txt**.

To reach out the encrypted data, the user can copy and paste the info on the referring entry and click on the 
`Load & Decrypt` button.

Required modules for this project are:

* **tkinter**
* **random**

<h2> How does it work?</h2>

This is how our program looks like:

The app expects the user to fill in the `Website`, `Email/Username`, and the `Password` respectively.

Firstly the user fills in the `Website` and the `Email/Username` entries as shown:

Secondly, the user can either fill in the `Password` or click on the `Generate Password` button and then, click the `Save & Encrypt` button:

As the user clicks the button, they get a 'askyesno' message box:

After the saving process, the user gets feedback and their email remains in the entry box:

The saved information is stored in `data.txt` file:

The user can enter the **encrypted data** in the related entry boxes and click the `Load & Decrypt` button to **decrypt** the data:

As the user attempts to decryption, another message box is shown:
